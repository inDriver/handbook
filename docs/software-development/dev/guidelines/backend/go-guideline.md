# Scope of the Guide

This guide covers a range of topics related to coding in Go, including code formatting, naming conventions, programming practices, code review rules, and unit testing. It also provides guidance on using various tools that can help in maintaining code quality, such as formatters and linters. However, it does not dictate how to solve specific programming problems, as those decisions are often context-dependent and best left to the individual developer or team.


## Expected Readership

While this guide is primarily intended for developers who write and review Go code, it can be a useful resource for anyone involved in the software development process at our company. Familiarity with the standards and practices outlined in this guide can facilitate better communication and understanding across different roles and teams.
