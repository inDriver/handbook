# About inDrive

**inDrive** is an international IT company that developed a namesake app for passenger transportation, delivery, and other services. Originally launched as an alternative to traditional taxis, inDrive offers a unique model where passengers and drivers negotiate the price of the ride directly, making the process more flexible and fair for both parties. The company has been in the market for over 10 years and is rapidly expanding worldwide, providing opportunities for both drivers and users while upholding principles of transparency and equality in its service.


# Mission and Values

Arsen Tomsky, the CEO of inDrive, has presented an updated edition of the company's values. These values are the fundamental rules that everyone at inDrive must follow.


## Our Mission

inDrive's mission is to reduce injustice in the world. As developists, by fulfilling this mission, we contribute to the world's development and make a significant impact on the common human mission mentioned earlier. Our mission was gifted to us by the history of inDrive itself. The company's creation was spurred by the action against unfair taxi pricing collusion in Yakutsk on a cold winter day in 2012. The entire remarkable history of inDrive is based on people sharing news with each other about the emergence of a more just, honest, and economical service, allowing us to grow in the absence of access to external resources.

Choosing this mission is also logical because justice is a universally understood, archetypal concept that resonates with every individual, regardless of age, gender, location, or other factors. This creates a strong foundation for the company's development, team motivation, and building stronger relationships with our users, government officials, the media, opinion leaders, and other stakeholders.

We are not merely earning money or making people's lives more convenient in one way or another. We are not making money in business and then allocating a portion of our earnings to social and charitable projects in an entirely different field, passing them to specialized foundations, as the vast majority of companies do with varying degrees of sincerity. We are doing something very important for millions of people â€“ reducing injustice. We do this in both the business and non-profit sectors (inVision programs), without dividing the two, and we do it ourselves.


## Challenging Injustice

One of the important steps in the evolution of the company's mission is that we are defining it more clearly. It now sounds like this: "challenging injustice". This is done for greater objectivity, clarity, and the mission's comprehensibility. We have discussed this extensively and realized that almost all types of societal problems are in one way or another connected to social injustice, including growing social inequality, lack of access to education and healthcare, discrimination of all kinds, racism, and other forms of social rejection and hatred, environmental issues, and much more.


# Strategic Goal 2030

The journey is primary, goals are secondary. inDrive's path is the development of the world through the realization of the mission. There is so much social injustice in the world that there is work for the company for many decades to come. In the process, goals are also needed as landmarks indicating progress along this path. We have decided that our main quantitative goal is to maximize the impact on people's lives. To make a positive impact on the lives of no less than one billion people by 2030. Setting and achieving goals related to our impact, rather than financial metrics, will allow us to:

* give the company more strength and weight, as impact is the primary currency in the world today;
* increasing impact will make the company more widely known, leading inDrive to become a role model for many other companies and giving us the opportunity to some extent to reimagine capitalism;
* this will directly lead to the growth of the company's financial metrics, including GMV, revenue, and its market valuation.

Financial metrics, while not being the primary goals like in many other companies, are essential for inDrive. First and foremost, we must maintain the financial health, security, and prosperity of the company and its employees. Furthermore, strong financial metrics will lead to a higher market valuation, which will increase the shareholder value and, as a result, inDrive's purchasing power. We intend to actively invest in and acquire external companies as a means of achieving our impact goal.


# Inner Drive

When we achieve our strategic goal of impacting the lives of 1 billion people, we will join the ranks of the largest, most successful, and well-known companies. We will become a role model for many thousands of other companies in the way they do business. Many of them will begin to adopt our ideology, where all company activities are based on a non-materialistic foundation and a purpose of existence that they fulfill through both business and non-commercial programs. We call this ideology "Inner Drive", and our new name, inDrive, originated from it. If those companies gain a high level of influence and financial success, there will be a chance to create a new kind of business, reinventing and reimagining capitalism.
