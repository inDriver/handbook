# Sprint Events

The following outlines the key team events typical in an iterative-incremental approach, based on the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle. These meetings are repeated every sprint.


## Description Format

Each meeting is described using the following format:

1. **Purpose**: what the meeting aims to achieve.
2. **Prerequisites**: what team members need to prepare.
3. **Artifacts**: what should be formalized as a result.
4. **Participants**: who should attend (mandatory and optional).


## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning marks the start of the sprint. During this meeting, the team addresses three main questions: **"Why is this sprint important?", "What will we do? How will we do it?"**.

1. **Purpose**:
    * define the **Sprint Goal**, aligning with product or quarterly objectives, and outline the value delivered during the sprint;
    * create the Sprint Backlog, which includes tasks needed to achieve the Sprint Goal, along with any technical investments, debt, or bugs.
2. **Prerequisites**: OKRs, Product Backlog, projected capacity for the team; 
3. **Artifacts**: Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog;
4. **Participants:** entire development team, Product Owner, external experts (optional).


## Daily Meeting

The Daily is a brief meeting (up to 15 minutes) for tracking progress toward the Sprint Goal. It helps identify and address barriers and adjust the Sprint Backlog as needed. It is not a status update or reporting meeting.

1. **Purpose:**
    * review progress towards the **Sprint Goal** and address any barriers;
    * optionally, discuss obstacles encountered.
2. **Prerequisites**: Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog;
3. **Artifacts**: updated team plan;
4. **Participants:** entire development team, Product Owner, external experts (optional).


## Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is held at the end of each sprint to evaluate the results and adjust the Product Backlog. It is a collaborative session between the team and stakeholders, not merely a demo.

1. **Purpose:**
    * review the sprintâ€™s outcomes (achievements and increment demonstration);
    * discuss future product development plans;
    * adjust the Product Backlog based on stakeholder feedback.
2. **Prerequisites:** Sprint Goal, increment.
3. **Artifacts:** adjusted Product Backlog (optional).
4. **Participants:** Product team, stakeholders.


## Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is the final event of the sprint, focusing on reviewing the sprint's processes, team interactions, and tools. The team identifies key obstacles, evaluates their resolution, and outlines improvements for the next sprint.

1. **Purpose:**
    * Identify process improvement areas;
    * Determine actions for improvement in the next sprint or later.
2. **Prerequisites:** process and technical metrics, significant sprint events;
3. **Artifacts:** Action Points for improvements (optionally formalized as tasks for the next sprint);
4. **Participants:** product team.


## Product Backlog Refinement (PBR)

PBR is an ongoing process for refining the Product Backlog. It is not confined to a single meeting and is conducted as needed.

1. **Purpose:**
    * refine and clarify the Product Backlog items.
    * prepare requirements for the next sprint.
2. **Prerequisites:** Product Backlog.
3. **Artifacts on the output:** refined backlog items, updated Product Backlog.
4. **Participants:** Product team, stakeholders (optional).
