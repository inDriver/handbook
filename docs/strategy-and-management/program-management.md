# Program Management

**Program of projects or initiatives** is a set of related initiatives that are organized and managed together to achieve the company's strategic goals. The program has a larger scale and duration than individual projects and covers a large volume of work. For successful program management, the company must have a plan that must be executed throughout the program.

**Technical Program Manager (TPM)** is a manager who is responsible for managing the entire program of initiatives and strategies, including initiation, planning, execution and completion of initiatives. The TPM works closely with both the company's management and the teams involved in the program. As a program leader, the TPM is responsible for achieving the program's goals, ensuring timely, high-quality execution of projects within the program. The TPM also manages the risks and problems that may arise during the program.


## Program planning funnel

1. Strategies (company, division, cluster).
2. Strategic initiatives.
3. Tech portfolio.


## Program stages

The program consists of several stages, each of which has its own processes and artifacts. Let's take a closer look at each stage.


## Initiation

At this stage the TPM works with the management of various divisions of the company to determine the needs and goals of the program. He conducts an assessment of potential benefits and risks, as well as together with the product and technical managers of the clusters determines the necessary resources. After that, a high-level plan of the program of projects is developed, which determines how the goals of the program will be achieved, the main high-level milestones of the program. Then the TPM coordinates the plan with key stakeholders from the company's management. 

**As a result, the following artifacts are created:**

1. High level description - connected to company, division, cluster OKRs.
2. Agreed program goals.
3. Scope - list of initiatives / projects within the Program.
4. Involved parties - sponsor, stakeholders, teams etc.
5. Agreed high-level program plan.
6. Risk assessment.


## Planning

The planning of the next quarter is carried out approximately a month before the end of the current quarter. The purpose of this stage is to develop and agree on a detailed plan of activities, determine the criteria for the success of the program, and plan the communications of the program. Based on the high-level program plan, the TPM determines the list of initiatives for the quarter and the success criteria of the program within the future quarter. After that, the TPM presents the list to the teams involved and requests estimates up to the sprint for individual initiatives, as well as information about dependencies between initiatives. After receiving the estimates, the TPM develops a detailed program plan for the quarter, which contains a schedule and takes into account dependencies between teams and initiatives.

The TPM organizes a dependency alignment session between teams, at which program participants take on commitments to implement planned initiatives in accordance with the plan. If necessary, the plan is adjusted. In the future, teams reflect the commitments made in their quarterly goals and results (OKR).

The TPM determines how communications will be organized in the program: communication channels, regular meetings for synchronization and reporting on the program.

The TPM presents the final plan of the program for the quarter to all participants and stakeholders of the program and tells about how communications will be organized in the program.

**Artifacts:**

1. Detailed plan of works for the quarter.
2. Success criteria.
3. Communication plan (Slack channel (optional), Status meetings).


## Execution

At this stage, teams are implementing planned initiatives. The TPM ensures that all initiatives are implemented according to plan, and also manages the risks and problems that may arise during the work. He also tracks the progress of the work and ensures timely informing of participants and stakeholders about the status and changes in the plan.

**Artifacts:**

1. Reports on the implementation.
2. Progress report.
3. Risk and problem report.
4. Adjusted plan.


### Completion

At this stage, the TPM completes the program of projects, checks the work done, compares the results with business goals and analyzes the performance of the program. He also assesses the success of the program, identifies lessons learned, and provides knowledge and resources transfer.

**Artifacts:**

1. Assessment of the success and compliance of the implemented initiatives with the goals of the program.
2. Analysis of the implementation of the program.
3. Lessons learned and improvement plan for the future.
4. Transition to support (if necessary).
