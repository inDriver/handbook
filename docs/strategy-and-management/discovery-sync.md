# Discovery Sync

> Discovery Sync is a public meeting where product managers talk about the intermediate or final results of the discovery process. This is a challenge of product problems and solutions by all meeting participants, as a result of which the product is convinced of the decision made or corrects it (and in exceptional cases even stops working on it).

The duration of the meeting is 1.5 hours (if there are not enough speakers, then shorter).

Speakers are announced in advance: they write that they want to speak on a specific day. After that, a schedule is created, which will be included in the body of the meeting the day before the meeting. So each invitee will be able to understand what topics will be covered at the meeting. 

Each product manager must present the discovery results at least once a quarter on Discovery Sync.

Analytics and designers can present the results both in pairs with product managers and separately, as topics appear and artifacts are ready. It is desirable to speak at least once a quarter.


## Goals

The goals of discovery sync:

* transparency and improvement of the discovery process;
* collective help to specific product managers, analysts and designers in the form of feedback, challenge and ideas (help of collective mind);
* increasing the visibility of discovery tasks;
* business value: we reduce the zone of uncertainty when working with the questions "what are we doing?" and "why are we doing it?";
* ability to give feedback on product design.

Attendees: business development, managers, developers of the product teams, marketing and attendees from other teams.


## Agenda

* 3-4 speakers per meeting;
* 20-30 minutes per speaker. It depends on the topic and the volume of research;
* speakers speak according to the schedule. Those who signed up earlier have priority in choosing a slot;
* the speaker can moderate his speech: all questions at the end, questions immediately when they arise, you can also divide the speech into parts, after which you can ask questions.

* the product manager managers share the results of the discovery process:
  * "what is the problem?";
  * "what is the solution?";
  * "what is the value of the solution if the initiatives are implemented?".
* the results of the research (quantitative and qualitative) and validation of hypotheses:
  * if you think it is important, tell us about the competitive analysis in the context of research problems or features.
* the results of A/B tests with the analysis of the results / conclusions and further steps.
* if there was a brainstorm, tell us about the main results â€” for example, the top ideas or problems.
* at what stage of development is the hypothesis? If this is the preparation of the UI, we show prototypes, layouts, tell about the results of the corridor testing, if it was conducted.
* if there is a design that is in the preparation stage, tell us about it.

What else is important to consider:

* not everyone is present in the context of your direction, so you can devote the first few minutes of the speech to immersion in the context;
* if some framework is applied, it is necessary to briefly tell about it.
