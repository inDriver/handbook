# System Review

> **System Review** — the meeting where teams demonstrate a comprehensive overview of new features that were implemented by teams during the last sprint. **System Review = (Value + Velocity + Progress) * All The Teams**.

It is conducted at the end of each sprint for each team.


## Goals

* transparency of the delivery process for Product + Business + Tech representatives and other interested parties;
* feedback on the delivered value and adjustment of further plans;
* finding points of interaction between teams;
* competition within product teams — competition + collaboration;* data on the pace of work of teams will allow to focus teams on the speed of delivery and quality of the delivered value;
* authorization of the result by the teams themselves.


## Difference from Team Sprint Review

* System Review is attended by participants who do not have time to attend separate team reviews;
* the focus of the sprint review is on goals and Stories, the system review — on OKR and features;
* the capabilities of the demonstration are limited in time — 10 minutes per team (against 60);
* there may be a large feature that many teams are doing. Then all teams show it as a whole.


## Attendees

* product team;
* Engineering Managers (EMs), Product Managers (PMs);
* Cluster Head of Engineering (HoE), Cluster Head of Product (HoP);
* Stakeholders (Business Developers, Marketing, Digital, etc.).


## Format

Each team for 10-12 minutes:

* briefly — teams showcase their progress towards quarterly goals;
* briefly — the goal of the sprint, how it relates to OKR;
* briefly — a description of the feature before its demonstration;
* demonstration of the feature on the staging environment (end-2-end scenario);
* briefly — team performance metrics (velocity, TTM, diagrams);
* plans for the next sprint;
* feedback and questions from stakeholders and adjacent teams.


## Process Metrics

The process metrics to be reviewed at the meeting:

* **Scope Drop** — displayed in the dashboard for both the current and previous sprint, using the formula: planned SP - implemented from planned SP) / planned SP;
* **Wasted Time** — the average time a feature remains in development without active work, for the current and last sprint, visualized in the dashboard;
* **Delivery Time** — the average time spent on the feature development, presented in the dashboard for the current and previous sprint.
* **Quality Rate** — an indicator of the quality of features released to production, shown on the dashboard;
* **Velocity Chart** — illustrates the team's planned versus actual work completed (in Story Points), as shown in the dashboard;
* **Sprint Report** — this chart tracks the remaining work over time during a sprint, offering insights into progress towards sprint goals. Available for viewing in Jira.


## Tips

* book a time slot in advance;
* features should be demonstrated by the immediate performers of tasks, not by the leads;
* demonstrate the features on the staging environment;
* minimize presentation part and not to waste time on it. Try to do it without presentation;
* if the feature is done by several teams, then they show it together;
* if there is nothing to show, the team should tell why;
* if 10 minutes is not enough for the demonstration, then the demonstration of the features and video recordings are allowed, so as not to break the timing.
