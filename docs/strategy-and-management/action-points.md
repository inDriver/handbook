# Action Points

Teams keep improvement points in the process backlog as separate tasks in Jira and place them in the working space of each team.


## Purpose

* transparency for the team and the organization;
* the ability to take tasks in a sprint in an explicit form, keep them in focus and not separate tasks for improving processes from any other activities in the sprint backlog;
* the ability to plan by sprints and embed in the overall roadmaps of the team;
* the ability to use analytics from the workflow;
* identifying growth points in the context of clusters and departments, integration with the TMBP dashboard.


## Improvement Action Points

* action points from sprint retrospectives, OKRs, projects;
* development tasks that were created as a result of retrospectives;
* action points after passing the Team Maturity Model.


## Action Points Flow

* one action = one task;
* the type of task is Task;
    * type of task can be User Story / Enabler, if during the retrospective, tasks were identified, **related to the code and they completely close the Action**.
* each task has a single standard label:
    * retrospective for all process changes identified at the retro;
    * TMM for points that were created after passing the TMM:
        * as you can see, tasks from the coach's backlog / side activities and side activities **do not** need to be marked with a **standardized** label, but it is welcome to keep them in the same epic and / or on the same board.
* Epic contains **[TeamName] Process Changes** in the name:
    * the epic also has labels;
    * a single epic or by quarters / types of work â€” at the discretion of the team.
* tasks for Action Points are added to the sprint backlog and are kept in the same way as regular tasks, but are not estimated;
* assignee for tasks in the backlog may be absent if the task in the process backlog is not prioritized;
* the tasks that will be taken to the sprint more that in a quarter have Low priority label;
* the Actions with TMM label are displayed in TMPB dashboard.
