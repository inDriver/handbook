# Pre-Delivery Process

The Pre-Delivery Process spans from identifying a product problem and developing a solution to reaching the "Ready for Development" stage.

This process covers everything from validating the necessity of solving a problem to detailing the product and technical solutions. It sits between the discovery and delivery phases, involving multiple iterations to prepare tasks for development.


## Main Goals of the Process

1. **Align Understanding:** Ensure all product team members have a unified understanding of the product problem and solution, often achieved by creating product artifacts that describe these aspects.
2. **Challenge the Solution:** Engage the development team in questioning and refining the product solution to foster team involvement and ownership.
3. **Prepare for Technical Implementation:** Identify and prepare the technical solution to reduce uncertainty and increase delivery predictability. This includes meeting the teamâ€™s Definition of Ready.

We do not prescribe a one-size-fits-all process; instead, you can adopt best practices or develop a process that suits your needs inside a Cluster. The key is to meet the iteration goals and monitor process metrics effectively.
