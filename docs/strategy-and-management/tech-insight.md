# Tech Insight

> **Tech Insight** — a meeting where platform teams demonstrate a comprehensive overview of their results for the last month.

Tech Insight is conducted at the end of the month on Friday for each team.


## Goals

* transparency of the delivery process for Product + Business + Tech representatives and other interested parties;
* feedback on the delivered value and adjustment of further plans;
* finding points of interaction between teams;
* competition within platform teams — competition + collaboration;* data on the pace of work of teams will allow to focus teams on the speed of delivery and quality of the delivered value;
* authorization of the result by the teams themselves.


## Format

Each team for 10-12 minutes:

* why — goals and focus for the period (4 weeks), how they relate to OKR or Strategic Initiative;
* what — highlights, achievements.
* implemented features:* briefly — description of the feature before its demonstration;
* demonstration of the feature on the staging environment (end-2-end scenario), documentation, analytics, …;
* insights — what conclusions were drawn, analytical work, research, experiments;
* how — team performance metrics (velocity, TTM, diagrams (?));
* what's next — plans for the next sprint;
* feedback and questions from stakeholders and adjacent teams.


## Attendees

* Product&Tech Division;
* Chief Technology Product Officer (CTPO);
* Senior Vice President (SVP) of Engineering;
* Heads of Engineering (HoEs) for Product and Platform Clusters;
* Engineering Managers (EMs), Staff Engineers, and optional team members;
* Stack Holders (Business Developers, Marketing, Digital, …) (optional);


## Tips

* book a time slot in advance;
* features should be demonstrated by the immediate performers of tasks, not by the leads;
* demonstrate the features on the staging environment;
* minimize presentation part and not to waste time on it. Try to do it without presentation;
* if the feature is done by several teams, then they show it together;
* if there is nothing to show, the team should tell why;
* if 10 minutes is not enough for the demonstration, then the demonstration of the features and video recordings are allowed, so as not to break the timing.
