# Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance criteria** — are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, customer or other system. They are unique to each user story and define the behavior of the function from the point of view of the end user.

It is a kind of contract between the product and the development team, it must satisfy a user story to confirm its readiness. The criteria are written in the format using the steps **Given** — **When** — **Then**, and are matched with user actions. Thanks to this, they are easy to convert into behavioral tests.

Well-written acceptance criteria help to avoid unexpected results at the end of the development stage and guarantee that all stakeholders and users will be satisfied with what they will receive.

The important aspect of acceptance criteria is that they must be defined before the development team starts working on a specific user story. Otherwise, there is a high probability that the results will not meet the needs and expectations of the client.


## The Format of Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria must be filled in each user task in a separate field "Acceptance criteria".

* given — the initial state of the scenario;
* when — a specific action that the user performs;
* then — the outcome of the action / expected result;
* and — used to continue any of the previous three statements.

The checklist format is not limited. The main thing is that the criteria are written in the acceptance criteria field in a Jira task and not in a separate artifact. All information must be in one place.

If there are too many criteria, then this is a reason to think about whether the task is too big and whether it is worth decomposing it into several stories.
