If the team is not in the team Performance Dashboard, calculate the ratio in Jira using two filters: \- ALL ISSUES: project \= PROJECTKEY AND issuetype in standardIssueTypes() AND resolved \>= \-16w order by created DESC \- ISSUES FOR TECH INVEST ONLY: project \= PROJECTKEY AND issuetype in standardIssueTypes() ORDER by created DESC \*\*\* To calculate the metric, the team must maintain techInvestments in the backlog. If this practice is not in place, go through the tasks retrospectively and determine whether there were any tasks for tech investments. To determine the percentage of tasks from platform communities, analyze the tasks from the output project \= PROJECTKEY AND issuetype in standardIssueTypes() AND "Backlog Type\[Dropdown\]" \= TechInvestments AND resolved \>= \-16w order by created DESC. We don't have any formal marker for community tasks yet, so we leave manual counting to the team's discretion. |
