# Estimation Process

Estimation is a collaborative effort involving the entire team, where all members contribute to estimating each story.

During planning, it’s often unknown who will tackle specific tasks, as implementing stories generally requires diverse expertise (e.g., user interface design, backend, iOS, Android, testing). For each team member to participate meaningfully in estimation, they need a clear understanding of the story’s requirements. Involving everyone in the estimation process ensures all team members grasp the story's details, enhancing mutual support during the sprint and surfacing critical questions early on.

The following tasks should be estimated:

* Stories;
* Enablers;
* Bugs.

Other types of tasks aren't estimated.

Re-estimation may be required in cases such as:

* moving a story to another sprint: this ensures we accurately plan team capacity for the new sprint;
* decomposing a large story: when a story proves too large for a single sprint, re-estimation helps break it down for more accurate planning;
* new information arises: if initial estimates were made before the sprint and additional requirements or obstacles emerge, re-estimation allows for adjustments based on the latest understanding.
