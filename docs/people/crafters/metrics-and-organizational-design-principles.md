# Metrics and Organizational Design Principles: The Crafters Model for High Performance

The Crafters Model defines key organizational metrics to drive high performance while using resources efficiently. It helps keep the system manageable without adding extra layers of management, ensuring a balance between structure and flexibility.

## Key Structural Segments of Organizational Design

Building a scalable and efficient tech organization requires a clear structure. Here are the three main segments that help maintain alignment, agility, and execution efficiency.

### 1. Cluster: A Strategic Group

A **Cluster** is a group of teams working toward a shared goal within a specific domain, using common metrics. It plays a key role in executing the technology strategy and maintaining accountability.

Each Cluster is led by a Head of Engineering or Director of Engineering, ensuring strategic alignment and performance.

### 2. Unit: A Focused Subgroup

A **Unit** is a smaller group within a Cluster, bringing together teams that work in the same specialized area. This structure allows for deeper domain expertise and more focused execution. Unit consists of at least 3 Teams.

Each Unit is led by Senior Engineering Manager or Head of Engineering, who coordinates efforts and drives results.

### 3. Team: A Cross-Functional Execution Segment

A **Team** is the core operational segment, consisting of Engineers, Product Managers, Designers, and/or Analysts. Teams own the end-to-end delivery within their scope, ensuring autonomy and agility.

Each Team is managed by an Engineering Manager or Senior Engineering Manager, responsible for execution and team development.

## Team Composition Principles and Metrics

Manager to Direct Reports Ratio:

- Ideal: 1:9.
- Possible range: 1:4 - 1:12.

QA Engineers to All Engineers Ratio:

- Ideal: 1:4 or lower (1:5, 1:6, etc).
- 2:7 is possible, 2:6 is not.

Staff Engineers:

- No more than 1 Staff Engineer per domain within one Unit (iOS, Android, Backend, Frontend, QA, etc). If more than one Staff Engineer appears within a domain in a Unit, they should be transferred to another Unit.
- Staff Engineers are not people managers, but they help standardize expertise and strategy across the Unit or Cluster.
- Staff Engineers are part of the leadership team, collaborating with EMs and Senior EMs.
- Staff Engineers may report to EMs, Senior EMs, Heads and Directors of Engineering.

Principal Engineers:

- 1 per domain.
- Typically based in the Platform Clusters.

## Seniority Levels Distribution

The principles described above define the distribution of different seniority levels across teams as:

- Juniors + Interns: 10%
- Middle: 35%
- Senior: 35%
- Staff: 8%
- Principal: 2% (~1 per domain)
- Managers: 10%

## Why This Structure Works

1. Ensures strategic alignment while keeping execution efficient.
2. Supports scalability without unnecessary complexity.
3. Balances autonomy and governance for high performance.

By structuring teams into Clusters, Units, and Teams, organizations can drive efficiency, accelerate decision-making, and create a strong engineering culture.
