## Preconditions

For a long time, inDrive operated with a relatively small engineering staff to support its business growth, product scaling, and expansion into new countries. However, as the company experienced aggressive growth and entered new markets, the demand for faster time-to-market and scalable solutions increased. To maintain this momentum, inDrive significantly expanded its workforce. Building and expanding teams became the primary approach that drove our inspiring results, rapidly growing the company from 100 to nearly 600 employees.

However, this approach is no longer sustainable. Today, we need to focus on building scalable solutions and reusing existing ones, rather than continuing to grow teams intensively.

In addition, the influx of new engineers brought a wide range of cultures and value systems into the company. With inDrive now operating in over 50 countries, the different mentalities and decision-making approaches have led to a "Tower of Babel" effect. People have been making decisions based on value models from their previous experiences, which has caused misunderstandings and conflicts.

As the company continues to grow, there is also a need to develop new sustainable processes and internal policies. With increasing complexity in communication and decision-making, it's crucial to address these challenges effectively.

As a result, the following priorities have emerged:

* as an international company, inDrive needs to establish a strong internal identity. This will enable all employees to make decisions based on common principles and values, with clear role expectations and growth opportunities;
* the company must also rethink its current approach to work by focusing on efficient engineering practices. This means creating and supporting solutions in a time-efficient manner, while optimizing resource use.

## What’s The Crafters Model?

**The Crafters Model** addresses the above prerequisites and focuses on engineers and their internal growth to unlock our full potential in achieving the company's goals and supermission.

* **for everyone**: illustrates the principles and core values on which the cultural layer of the technology division is based, aligning them with the company’s values;
* **for all individual contributors**: clarifies how to achieve impact in your role and how to grow in your engineering career;
* **for managers**: helps set expectations with your team members and hold them accountable for their work;
* **for the organization**: establishes the foundational principles of organizational design by which the model's principles are implemented.

## What the Crafters Model is Not

* this model is not a promotion checklist for your role; if you're interested in promotions, please refer to the TalentTrek program;
* this model does not cover all existing tools and processes, such as Job Profile, or Personal Development Plan; it uses these tools to answer the question: "How can I meet the principles and expectations described in the model?".

## How to Use This Model?

* the model is a foundational document that defines role expectations; it does not prescribe specific actions but provides guidance;
* for more detailed actions or advice, ask your manager for assistance.
