# Crafters Model


## Model Principles

* do the mastery;
* amplify the impact;
* cultivate the fostering environment.

| Principle              | Description                                                                                                                                    | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Do the mastery**     | We **strive** for excellence in our field. We achieve high levels of quality in our work, making significant contributions to product creation | **Be like**: "As a front-end developer, I have basic mastery of the backend and write simple code for it now.". <br> **Avoid**: "I improved my service, but did not take into account the dependence of other services on it my change disrupted the services of my colleagues" |
| **Amplify the impact** | We **engage** in understanding how and why our product works. We **invest** our time into meaningful outcomes                                  | **Be like:** "I took part in field research, and the data I collected helped to ..."                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                     

## Engineering Tracks

For each principle, we can identify correlated tracks that highlight different aspects of the principle.

We have extracted three tracks, each of which is important for every principle, but they contribute to them at different levels.

For example, the craftsmanship track contributes most significantly to the "Do the Mastery" principle (as it's obviously focused on mastering skills). However, other tracks, such as Impact and Behavior, also play a significant role in shaping this principle.

You can see below how principles and tracks are related to each other.

### Engineering Ladder

For each engineering position, we can suggest a combination of different tracks in varying amounts. Using this approach, we can describe each position as a set of expectations across different tracks.

| Employee level | Craftsmanship | Impact | Behaviour  |
|----------------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Junior         | C1           | I1     | B0         |
| Middle         | C2           | I2     | B1         |
| Senior         | C3           | I3     | B2         |
| Staff          | C4           | I4     | B3         |
| EM             | C3           | I4     | B4         |
| HoE            | C3           | I5     | B5         |
| Director       | C4           | I6     | B6         |
