# Engineer Track

> **NOTE**
>
> This page is your guide to growth within the company and can help you understand the expectations for engineering roles.

Each role includes three engineering tracks (namely Craftsmanship, Impact, and Behavior) along with general competencies for individual contributors (engineers).

Each track, in turn, is represented as a set of competencies, which are present across all levels of positions.

Each competence has its own description and expectations, tailored to a specific level or grade. This is why we do not provide detailed explanations for each here. For example, expectations for a competence like systems thinking or operational excellence may vary significantly from Junior to Senior levels and beyond.

Below is the list of competencies for each engineering track. Detailed expectations for these competencies will follow.

| Craftsmanship                  | Impact                 | Behavior                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Delivery Process               | Aspiration to Extend   | Collaborative Engagement |
| Design Adoption                | Experimental Spirit    | Effective Communication  |
| Design Process                 | Operational Excellence | Influence                |
| Promotion                      | Ownership              | Talent Growth            |
| Software Engineering           | Pre-delivery Process   |                          |
| Strategic Thinking             | Strategy Execution     |                          |
| Sustainability and Reliability |                        |                          |
| System Thinking                |                        |                          |

## Levels of Ladder

Using the approach with engineering tracks and competencies, we can generate a set of expectations for each role. We expect different things under each competency depending on the level.

> **NOTE**
>
> We have a set of expectations for roles regardless of specific specializations or professions. At this stage, we acknowledge that the expectations for a specific grade are universal across all professions at that grade.

To clarify further, we'd like to emphasize once again: according to the Crafters model, expectations for different professions at the same level are the same. For example, our expectations for any Mid-level Mobile Engineer should be the same as for any Mid-level Backend Developer, at least in terms of the shared competencies.

The specific professions are covered under [Job Profiles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pr01wx_KcfH1dK4tSDUHJ-guKyCgiZQP), which go beyond the Crafters model but are based on it.
