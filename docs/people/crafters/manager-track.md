# Manager Track

> **NOTE**

> This page is your source for how to grow in the company and it can help you understand the expectations from engineering roles.


## Recap

 Each role includes 3 engineering tracks (namely Craftsmanship, Impact and Behaviour) and general competencies for managers.

Each track in its turn can be represented as a set of Competences, which appear at all levels of positions.

Each competence has its own description and expectations, tailored to the specific level/grade. That's the reason why we don't provide here an explanation for each of them. (e.g. expectation from any competence, like System thinking or Operational Excellence and so on, may vary a lot from Junior to Senior and beyond

Here is the list of Competences for each Manager track. Detailed expectations from these Competences to follow:

| Craftmanship | Impact | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System thinking | Aspiration to extend | Collaborative engagement |
| Strategic thinking | Experimental spirit | Talent growth |
| Promotion | Ownership | Influence |
| Design process | Pre-delivery process | Effective communication |
| Design adoption | Strategy execution |   |
| Software engineering | Operational excellence |   |
| Delivery process |   |   |
| Sustainability and reliability |   |   |


## Levels of a ladder

Using the approach with Manager tracks and Competences, we can generate a set of Expectations for each role. We expect different things under every Competence depending on the level.

Mind the following: We have a set of expectiations for roles ***regardless*** the specific specialization/profession. At this step we acknowledge that Expectations from a specific grade are universal across all the different professions at this grade.
