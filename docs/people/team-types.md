# Types of Teams

At inDrive, we typically have two types of teams that work in constant collaboration. As the company scales, teams of the same type are grouped into units and clusters. Interactions that were previously handled between individual teams are now managed at the unit or cluster level.

* Product teams;
* Platform teams.


## Product Team

* teams are usually structured around a specific business vertical, focusing development efforts on the end user of a particular part of the application;
* each team is aligned with the product and business metrics of its vertical. If multiple teams operate within the same vertical, the metrics are distributed across different stages of the funnel;
* teams operate independently within their vertical, generating and implementing product development ideas;
* in some cases, in addition to working with the end user, teams provide services and/or tools to other teams for implementing business requirements (e.g., A/B testing platform);
* each team has a dedicated product manager.


## Platform Team

* the team is responsible for maintaining the stability and development of a specific part of the technology platform, while also establishing standards and promoting best practices within that area;
* product teams serve as the primary customers and end users;
* the team does not have direct product metrics but influences them indirectly by:
  * ensuring platform quality (e.g., SLA), testability, and scalability;
  * collaborating with stakeholders (product teams) to set goals and guide platform development.
* the team has a dedicated Platform Owner who is responsible for the technical implementation of the platform and works to remove obstacles that may hinder the team's effectiveness.
