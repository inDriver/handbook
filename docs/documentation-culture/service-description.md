# Service Description


## General Rules for Structure Usage

* if content is unavailable for one of the above sections it is better to specify "N / A" to show that it is not applicable for this service and no data should be specified (the absence of the information is also information about the service);
* the high level sections of structure can include any subsections relevant to the service description;
* `.md` files should be named like the above mandatory top-level sections.


## Document Structure

>**NOTE**
>
> If a section is specified as a mandatory section it means that this description should be provided in the documentation is a service has these characteristics.

The service has the following structure:

### Functional Requirements (Mandatory Section)

Specify the features that are covered by the service and for which the service was developed.


### Operation Algorithm (Mandatory Section)

Here shall be specified the step-by-step description of the performing actions for the services supported by PlantUML sequence diagrams.


#### Interaction with a Client (Optional Section)

> The interaction with a client and with external services **should be maintained next to the service code base not in the repos of mobile clients.** Feel free to adapt the blow structure based on your specific project requirements!


##### Introduction

In this section, provide a brief introduction to the service / server and client interaction. Describe the overall goal and scope of application.


##### Registration and Authentication

Describe the procedure for client registration in the system. You might need a PlantUML diagram to visualize this process.

Explain how the client conducts authentication in the system. Include examples of tokens, keys, or other authentication methods.


##### API and Endpoints

Provide a general overview of the API, including available endpoints and their purposes. Use PlantUML diagrams to visualize the API structure.


##### Interaction with Client

Provide the scenario of interaction in PlantUML format.


##### Working with Resources

Data retrieval: describe how the client application can retrieve data from the service. You may need a PlantUML diagram to visualize this process.

Data submission: explain how the client application submits data to the server. Use a PlantUML diagram to visualize this process.


##### Error Handling

Describe how errors are handled on both the client and server sides. You may need a PlantUML diagram to illustrate error scenarios.


##### Usage Examples

Provide concrete examples of how the service can be used in the client application. PlantUML diagrams may be needed to illustrate usage scenarios.


##### Limits and Restrictions

Describe any limits and restrictions related to service usage. Include a PlantUML diagram if needed to illustrate these limitations.


### Non-Functional Requirements (Mandatory Section)


#### Security Requirements (Mandatory Section)

Description of security measures, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and other security aspects.


#### Reliability Requirements (Mandatory Section)

Level of service availability, frequency of failures, recovery after failures, and other reliability aspects.


#### Performance Requirements (Mandatory Section)

Expected performance of the service, including response time, throughput, and other performance characteristics.


### Service Configuration (Mandatory Section)

In the context of microservice architecture, **Service Configuration** includes the parameters and settings necessary for the proper functioning of a microservice. It typically covers two key aspects:

1. **Environment and infrastructure:**
   * **environment variables:** these include variables like database URLs, API keys, operating modes (production, staging, development), and other settings that may change depending on the environment in which the microservice is deployed;
   * **network configuration:** this involves settings related to connecting with other services, such as service addresses, DNS settings, ports, use of proxies, and load balancing;
   * **secrets management:** secure storage and access to sensitive information, such as passwords, certificates, encryption keys. This might involve integration with secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

2. **Service functional parameters:**
   * **functional settings:** these are configurations that define the service's behavior, such as request limits, queue sizes, API request timeouts, caching configurations;
   * **logging and monitoring configuration:** this includes enabling and configuring logging, log level detail, monitoring metrics, and tracing to observe the performance and availability of the service;
   * **external dependencies configuration:** configurations related to interacting with other microservices or external APIs, including data formats, communication protocols, retry strategies, etc.


### Database (Mandatory Section)

Description of the used database, its type, data model, table structure, relationships between them, and other features.

* description of tables;
* PlantUML ER-diagrams.


### Troubleshooting and Monitoring (Mandatory Section)

The documentation has a troubleshooting section (either standalone or included within the section it relates to) that provides information on how to solve common problems. The troubleshooting information indicates where things might go wrong and how to fix them.

Proposed description format #1:

Issue 1

Description:

Steps to fix:<br>1.<br>2. ...

Issue 2

Description:

Steps to fix:<br>1.<br>2. ...

The section also can include the alerts and their interpretation as well as a list of all error messages and provide additional information on why they occur and how to resolve them.

Proposed description format #2:

| Error code | Error message | Error reason | Error fix (step-by-step description of actions to resolve an error) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |


### Known Limitations (Mandatory Section)

This section shall include all pitfalls and gaps to avoid. The documentation does not lie or mislead the user but rather is transparent, honest, and helpful.


### Integration (Mandatory Section)

Description of all integrations with other services or systems, including methods of interaction and data formats, if they are available and critical for the service.

See the template for integration description [here](integrations.md).


### Runbook

Runbooks contain step-by-step instructions on how engineers should respond to alerts. These runbooks are typically attached to the specific alert they address. Best practices for runbooks include clearly indicating the severity of the alert, forecasting potential issues that may arise if the alert is triggered, and providing suggestions on how to resolve or fix the problem. Additionally, they should outline the steps engineers need to take to mitigate the impact of the alert and completely resolve the issue.

When an alert is triggered, it's essential to determine whether the runbook is still relevant and up to date. If needed, the runbook should be revised. Runbooks are designed to reduce workload, minimize Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), and lower the risk of human error. They also facilitate knowledge sharing within the team. Therefore, runbooks must include all necessary tools for investigating the incident, such as Grafana dashboards, Kibana indexes, configuration files, service documentation, and contact information for engineers from related services. Any commands provided in the runbook should be clear, unambiguous, and ready to execute.

If you notice that a runbook consists of a predetermined list of commands that the on-duty engineer applies each time an alert is triggered, it is advisable to automate that runbook.


### How to Add a Runbook to an Alert

The link to the runbook is typically added to the alert annotations as follows:

```yaml
annotations:
  runbook_url: <link to runbook>
```


### Contributing (Mandatory Section)

### Glossary (Mandatory Section)

The format:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
