# Design Standards and Development


## ADR Design Agreement

To scale up architecture and development processes, a tool is needed to record all major decisions made at the project or company level. This documentation, known as an Architectural Decision Record (ADR), provides a structured approach for tracking significant architectural choices.

An ADR is a document that captures a team's decision regarding a critical aspect of the software architecture they plan to implement. Each ADR details the architectural decision, the context in which it was made, and the potential consequences. Since ADRs evolve, they follow a lifecycle, with each ADR having specific states as it progresses.


## Decision


### ADR Storage

All ADRs should be stored in the `architecture-docs` repository. Each ADR must be in a separate markdown file with a name following the **Naming Conventions**. ADRs must be placed in the `adrs` folder with this structure:


```text
architecture-docs/
├─ service 1/
├─ service 2/
│  ├─ adrs/
│    ├─ 0000-ECO-100-service-topic-1.md
│    ├─ 0001-ECO-500-service-topic-2.md
├─ service 3/
│  ├─ adrs/
│    ├─ 0000-NO-146-service-topic-1.md
│    ├─ 0001-NO-420-service-topic-2.md
├─ adrs/
|  ├─ 0000-ARCH-42-global-topic-1.md
│  ├─ 0001-ARCH-73-global-topic-2.md
├─ README.md
````

The root-level `adrs` directory stores company-level decisions, while services / products MAY have their own `adrs` directories for service-specific ADRs.


### Naming Conventions

Each ADR file name must include:

* zero-padded ADR number (4 digits) followed by `-`. Numbering is independent per `adrs` directory;
* Jira ticket number followed by `-`;
* a two-three word brief of the ADR’s subject with `-` instead of spaces.

Example: 0000-Ticket-0-adr-agreement.md


### Document Structure

ADRs should include the following sections:

* **Title** [required]: brief description of the document;
* **Status** [required]: document status based on ADR lifecycle;
* **Context** [required]: problem description and current knowledge of limiting factors;
* **Options** [optional]: considered options, their pros and cons;
* **Decision** [required]: chosen option description with pros and cons;
* **Successor** [optional]: link to a new decision replacing this one;
* **Supersedes** [optional]: list of links to superseded documents.


### ADR Lifecycle

Project-scope ADRs should be reviewed and accepted by project code owners. Company-scoped ADRs must be reviewed by the architecture team and undergo standard voting. Company-wide decisions should be published in the `#dev` Slack channel.
