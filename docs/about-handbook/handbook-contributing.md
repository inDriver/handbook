## Using Issue Tracker for Making Updates

1. **Creating an issue**:
   * go to the **Issues** tab in the repository and click **New Issue**;
   * describe the problem or suggest an improvement. Include details like the issue description, where changes are needed, screenshots, or relevant links;
   * click **Submit** to create the issue.
2. **Issue discussion**: use the issue comments to clarify details, make suggestions, or ask questions. This is a space to discuss with other project contributors.
3. **Assigning the issue**: the project owner or the issue creator can assign the issue to themselves or another contributor using the **Assignees** option.
4. **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**:
   * after making changes in the forked version of the repository, create a **Pull Request (PR)**;
   * in the PR description, reference the issue number with a keyword to automatically close the issue, for example: `Fixes #issue_number`.
5. **Review and merge**:
   * once the PR is created, the team reviews the changes. The PR may be discussed and, after review, merged into the main project branch;
   * after the PR is merged, the issue is automatically closed if the proper keywords (e.g., `Fixes`) were used.

**Key keywords for closing issues**:

* `Fixes #issue_number`;
* `Closes #issue_number`;
* `Resolves #issue_number`.
