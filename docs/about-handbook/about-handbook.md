# About Handbook

Our handbook serves as a vital resource to ensure that all important information is easily accessible to everyone, regardless of when they join the team. It plays a key role in our culture, fostering transparency and effective communication. Maintaining the handbook is a shared responsibility, and it provides several important benefits:

* **faster access to information**: reading is quicker than meetings, helping everyone find what they need without delays;
* **asynchronous access**: team members can consult the handbook on their own time without disrupting others;
* **clear documentation of changes**: up-to-date information makes it easier to discuss and implement changes;
* **collaboration**: everyone is encouraged to contribute by suggesting improvements.

By keeping the handbook current, we streamline onboarding, maintain consistent practices, improve efficiency, and foster a collaborative environment. It's a tool that captures our collective knowledge, ensuring that we work smarter and grow together. Let's take ownership and continuously improve it.
