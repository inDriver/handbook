# Handbook Ownership

Any member of the inDrive team can contribute to the documentation and suggest relevant changes.

However, the responsibility for the accuracy of the documentation rests with the owners of the specific pages. These owners are specified in the [`CODEOWNERS`](./../../CODEOWNERS) file by mutual agreement of the teams.
