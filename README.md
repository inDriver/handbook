# inDrive Engineering Handbook

Welcome to the inDrive Engineering Handbook repository, maintained by the inDrive Engineering Team. This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide, outlining best practices and standards upheld by the inDrive team.


## Handbook Purpose

The inDrive Engineering Handbook aims to establish and promote effective practices and shared standards, encouraging collaboration within inDrive and with the broader community. By removing barriers, optimizing workflows, and providing easy access to best practices, we support both internal projects and external contributions.

In this handbook, you'll find resources, templates, and tools intended to boost productivity and ensure consistency across all inDrive engineering.
