# inDrive Open Source Handbook

Welcome to the inDrive Open Source Handbook repository, maintained by the inDrive Engineering Team. This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide, outlining best practices and standards upheld by the inDrive team.


## Purpose of the Open Source Handbook

The inDrive Open Source Handbook aims to establish and promote effective practices and shared standards, encouraging collaboration within inDrive and with the broader community. By removing barriers, optimizing workflows, and providing easy access to best practices, we support both internal projects and external contributions.
